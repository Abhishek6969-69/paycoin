# 🎉 Build Issue Fixed - Ready for Deployment!

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Wallet Page Build Error**
- **Problem**: `/wallet` page was using `useSearchParams()` without Suspense boundary
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `WalletClient.tsx` component with proper hydration handling
  - Added Suspense boundary to `wallet/page.tsx`
  - Implemented client-side check to prevent hydration mismatches

### 2. **Bank Server Deployment**
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed to Vercel
- **URL**: `https://coinpay-bank-server-o368y3tgd-abhishek-yadavs-projects-2d9d8cfa.vercel.app`
