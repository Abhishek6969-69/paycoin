3. **Add the following variables**:

```bash
# Your webhook service URL (replace with your deployed webhook URL)
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-service.vercel.app

# Shared secret for webhook authentication
WEBHOOK_SECRET=super_secret_shared_with_webhook

# Your main app's transactions page URL (replace with your deployed app URL)
CLIENT_RETURN_URL=https://your-main-app.vercel.app/transactions
```

---

## üîó **Next Steps to Complete Integration**

### 1. Update Your Main App Configuration
In your main CoinPay app's environment variables, add:

```bash
# Point to your deployed bank server
NEXT_PUBLIC_BANK_SERVER_URL=https://coinpay-bank-server-o368y3tgd-abhishek-yadavs-projects-2d9d8cfa.vercel.app
```

### 2. Deploy Your Webhook Service
Deploy your webhook service (`apps/bank-webhook`) to Vercel and get its URL to use in the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.

### 3. Deploy Your Main App
Deploy your main app (`apps/user-app`) to Vercel and get its URL to use in the `CLIENT_RETURN_URL` environment variable.

### 4. Update Environment Variables
Once all services are deployed, update the environment variables in all three Vercel projects to point to the correct URLs.
